\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduce deep learning models to the design of network intrusion detection system.
First, we briefly discuss general deep learning methodology and
its potential implication on the network intrusion detection problem.
Then we describe a set of promising deep learning models in concisely mathematical languages.
With the help of our public available Tensorflow-based deep learning library NetLearner,
we conduct a quantitatively comparative evaluation of these models on two popular
off-line network intrusion detection tasks. 
Preliminary experiment results show that for the NSL-KDD test dataset, xxxxxx;
for the UNSW-NB15 dataset, xxxxxx.
