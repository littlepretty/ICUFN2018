\begin{abstract}
Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is essential to the security of any communication systems.
Recently a handful of novel deep neural networks bundled with more advanced and smarter
training algorithms have achieved unprecedentedly good performance on image classification,
natural language processing, speech recognition and many other research branches.
Motivated by these impressive improvements in the field of artificial intelligence,
this paper introduces a bunch of deep learning models to the design of NIDS
and conducts a comparative evaluation of these models.
Firstly, we introduce general deep learning methodology and its potential implication on the
network intrusion detection problem.
Then we briefly review the existing machine learning solutions to two network intrusion detection tasks,
namely the NSL-KDD dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset.
After describing a set of cutting-edge deep learning models,
we conduct a quantitatively comparative evaluation of them with the help of
our own TensorFlow-based deep learning library, NetLeaner.
